# Weekly Goal Widget Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementing the Weekly Goal Widget feature based on PRD requirements. This will be a native Android widget that displays current week's goals from the Dingo app with quick interaction capabilities.

## Analysis Summary

### Current App Structure
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with multi-module structure
- **Modules**: `:app`, `:ui`, `:data`, `:domain`, `:common`
- **Key Technologies**: Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Firebase, Room
- **Goal Model**: Already exists with week/year tracking (`Goal.kt`)
- **Repository**: `GoalRepository` interface with Firebase implementation
- **Min SDK**: 24 (supports widgets), Target SDK: 34

### Key Integration Points
1. **Goal Data Model**: Existing `Goal` class already has `weekOfYear` and `yearCreated` fields
2. **Repository**: `GoalRepository` with methods like `getGoalsByGridPosition()` and `getGoalsByStatus()`
3. **Firebase Integration**: Real-time sync already implemented
4. **Module Dependencies**: Widget will depend on `:domain` and `:data` modules

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Add required widget dependencies (androidx.glance)
- [x] Create basic AppWidgetProvider
- [x] Implement widget data source from existing GoalRepository
- [x] Create basic 2x2 widget layout with goal display
- [x] Add widget configuration to AndroidManifest.xml

### Phase 2: Goal Display & Interaction (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement goal card rendering with status indicators
- [ ] Add goal tap functionality to open main app to current week
- [ ] Implement data synchronization with main app
- [ ] Add loading and error states
- [ ] Integrate with Firebase for real-time updates

### Phase 3: Week Navigation & Multiple Layouts (Week 3)
- [ ] Add week navigation functionality (previous/next week)
- [ ] Implement multiple widget sizes (2x2, 2x3, 3x2)
- [ ] Add widget configuration activity
- [ ] Implement week filtering logic

### Phase 4: Polish & Advanced Features (Week 4)
- [ ] Apply Mountain Sunrise theme consistency
- [ ] Add background refresh scheduling
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and offline support
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Testing and documentation

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Module Structure
Create widget components within the `:app` module:
```
app/src/main/java/io/sukhuat/dingo/widget/
â”œâ”€â”€ WeeklyGoalWidgetProvider.kt
â”œâ”€â”€ WeeklyGoalWidgetService.kt
â”œâ”€â”€ WeeklyGoalWidgetRepository.kt
â”œâ”€â”€ WeeklyGoalWidgetConfigActivity.kt
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WidgetGoal.kt
â””â”€â”€ ui/
    â”œâ”€â”€ WeeklyGoalWidget.kt
    â””â”€â”€ GoalWidgetCard.kt
```

### 2. Dependencies to Add
```kotlin
// In app/build.gradle.kts
implementation("androidx.glance:glance-appwidget:1.0.0")
implementation("androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.8.1") // For background updates
```

### 3. Key Components

#### WidgetGoal Data Model
```kotlin
data class WidgetGoal(
    val id: String,
    val text: String,
    val imageResId: Int?,
    val customImage: String?,
    val status: GoalStatus,
    val weekOfYear: Int,
    val yearCreated: Int,
    val position: Int
)
```

#### Week Navigation Logic
- Filter goals by `weekOfYear` and `yearCreated`
- Support navigation up to 4 weeks in the past
- Current week as default with clear indication

#### Data Synchronization
- Use existing `GoalRepository` for data access
- Implement broadcast receiver for app-to-widget updates
- Schedule periodic background updates (30 minutes)
- Handle offline scenarios with cached data

### 4. Widget Sizes & Layouts
- **2x2**: 4 goals in grid, minimal header
- **2x3**: 6 goals in grid, with week navigation
- **3x2**: 6 goals horizontally, wide layout
- **4x2**: 8 goals with statistics (future enhancement)

### 5. Theme Integration
- Apply Mountain Sunrise color scheme
- Glass morphism effects for goal cards
- Support both light/dark Android themes
- Consistent with main app visual design

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Must work with existing Goal model and repository
- Should not duplicate data storage (reuse Room database)
- Maintain performance standards (< 1s load, < 20MB memory)
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Widget displays current week's goals correctly
- [ ] Goal completion toggle works and syncs with main app
- [ ] Week navigation functions properly
- [ ] Multiple widget sizes supported
- [ ] Consistent visual theme with main app
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 1s load, < 20MB memory)
- [ ] Proper error handling and offline support
- [ ] Background sync works reliably
