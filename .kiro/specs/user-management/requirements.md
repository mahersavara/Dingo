# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The user management feature provides comprehensive administrative capabilities for managing user accounts, permissions, and system access within the Dingo application. This feature enables administrators to create, modify, and monitor user accounts while providing users with self-service capabilities for account management. The system will support role-based access control, user lifecycle management, and audit trails for compliance and security purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create and manage user accounts, so that I can control who has access to the system and what permissions they have.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the user management interface THEN the system SHALL display a list of all user accounts with their current status
2. WHEN an administrator creates a new user account THEN the system SHALL require username, email, and initial role assignment
3. WHEN an administrator creates a user account THEN the system SHALL generate a secure temporary password and send account activation instructions
4. WHEN an administrator modifies user permissions THEN the system SHALL update the user's access rights immediately
5. WHEN an administrator deactivates a user account THEN the system SHALL revoke all active sessions and prevent future logins
6. IF a user account is being deleted THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and log the deletion action

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to assign and manage user roles and permissions, so that users have appropriate access levels for their responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator assigns a role to a user THEN the system SHALL apply all permissions associated with that role
2. WHEN an administrator creates a custom role THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific permissions from available options
3. WHEN role permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL update access for all users with that role immediately
4. IF a user has multiple roles THEN the system SHALL grant the union of all permissions from assigned roles
5. WHEN an administrator views user permissions THEN the system SHALL display both direct permissions and role-inherited permissions clearly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor user activity and access patterns, so that I can ensure system security and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in or out THEN the system SHALL record the timestamp, IP address, and device information
2. WHEN an administrator accesses the audit log THEN the system SHALL display user activities with filtering and search capabilities
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and optionally lock the affected account
4. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN the system SHALL provide user access summaries and permission changes over specified time periods
5. IF login attempts exceed the threshold THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account and notify administrators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my own account settings and security preferences, so that I can maintain control over my personal information and account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses account settings THEN the system SHALL allow modification of personal information, password, and notification preferences
2. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL require current password verification and enforce password complexity rules
3. WHEN a user enables two-factor authentication THEN the system SHALL guide them through setup and provide backup codes
4. WHEN a user views their login history THEN the system SHALL display recent sessions with location and device information
5. IF a user requests account deletion THEN the system SHALL require identity verification and provide data export options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to bulk manage users through import/export capabilities, so that I can efficiently handle large-scale user operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator imports users from CSV THEN the system SHALL validate data format and create accounts with specified roles
2. WHEN an administrator exports user data THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with user information and current permissions
3. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and error reporting for failed operations
4. IF duplicate users are detected during import THEN the system SHALL provide options to skip, update, or merge accounts
5. WHEN bulk role assignments are made THEN the system SHALL apply changes and log all modifications for audit purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure user management policies and security settings, so that the system meets organizational security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring password policies THEN the system SHALL allow setting complexity requirements, expiration periods, and history restrictions
2. WHEN setting session policies THEN the system SHALL support configurable timeout periods and concurrent session limits
3. WHEN enabling account lockout policies THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of attempt thresholds and lockout durations
4. IF integration with external authentication systems is required THEN the system SHALL support LDAP/Active Directory and SAML protocols
5. WHEN configuring user registration THEN the system SHALL support both open registration and admin-only account creation modes
