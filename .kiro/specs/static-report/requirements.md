# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The static report feature will provide users with comprehensive, exportable reports of their learning progress, achievements, and statistics within the Dingo language learning app. This feature will generate static reports that can be viewed within the app, shared with others, or exported for external use, helping users track their learning journey and showcase their accomplishments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to generate comprehensive progress reports, so that I can track my learning journey and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a progress report THEN the system SHALL generate a report containing at least: total lessons completed, total study time (hours/minutes), average accuracy percentage, current streak count, and words learned
2. WHEN generating a report THEN the system SHALL include separate data sections for last 30 days, last 90 days, and all-time periods with clear date range labels
3. WHEN a report is generated THEN the system SHALL display progress trends using line charts for daily activity, bar charts for lesson completion, and pie charts for skill distribution
4. WHEN displaying accuracy metrics THEN the system SHALL show accuracy percentages by skill type (reading, writing, listening, speaking) and lesson category
5. IF insufficient data exists (less than 3 days of activity) THEN the system SHALL display "Limited data available - continue learning to see detailed insights" with suggestions for next steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my learning reports in multiple formats, so that I can share my progress with others or keep personal records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects export options THEN the system SHALL provide PDF, PNG, and JSON format options with clear format descriptions
2. WHEN exporting to PDF THEN the system SHALL generate a formatted A4 document with embedded charts, statistics table, app branding, and user's name/date
3. WHEN exporting to PNG THEN the system SHALL create a 1080x1920 shareable image with key metrics, progress charts, and social media optimized layout
4. WHEN exporting to JSON THEN the system SHALL provide structured data including all metrics, timestamps, and metadata for external analysis tools
5. WHEN export is initiated THEN the system SHALL show progress indicator and estimated completion time
6. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages (storage full, network error, etc.) with retry and alternative format options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my reports with different themes and layouts, so that I can personalize the appearance and focus on specific metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing report customization THEN the system SHALL provide at least 6 different visual themes (Light, Dark, High Contrast, Medieval Parchment, Vintage Scholar, Dragon's Lair) with preview thumbnails and theme descriptions
2. WHEN selecting report sections THEN the system SHALL allow users to toggle on/off specific data categories: progress metrics, achievements, time analysis, accuracy breakdown, and streak information
3. WHEN customizing layout THEN the system SHALL provide options for chart types (bar/line/pie), color schemes, and metric priority ordering with drag-and-drop interface
4. WHEN saving customization preferences THEN the system SHALL store user choices locally and apply them automatically to future report generations
5. WHEN resetting customization THEN the system SHALL provide "Reset to Default" option that restores original theme and layout settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to schedule automatic report generation, so that I can receive regular updates on my progress without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up scheduled reports THEN the system SHALL provide weekly, monthly, and custom interval options with specific day/time selection
2. WHEN a scheduled report is due THEN the system SHALL generate the report automatically using the user's saved customization preferences
3. WHEN scheduling is enabled THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify delivery preferences (in-app notification with preview, local storage location)
4. WHEN managing scheduled reports THEN the system SHALL provide options to pause, modify, or cancel existing schedules
5. IF scheduled generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry once after 1 hour and notify the user with specific error details and manual generation option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view historical reports, so that I can compare my progress over different time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing report history THEN the system SHALL display a list of previously generated reports with timestamps
2. WHEN selecting a historical report THEN the system SHALL display the report in read-only mode
3. WHEN viewing multiple reports THEN the system SHALL provide comparison tools to highlight changes over time
4. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL automatically archive older reports while preserving the most recent ones

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my reports to include achievement badges and milestones, so that I can showcase my accomplishments and motivation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a report THEN the system SHALL include all earned achievement badges with dates
2. WHEN displaying milestones THEN the system SHALL show completed challenges, streaks, and level progressions
3. WHEN including achievements THEN the system SHALL provide visual representations of badges and progress indicators
4. IF no achievements exist THEN the system SHALL display motivational messages about upcoming milestones
