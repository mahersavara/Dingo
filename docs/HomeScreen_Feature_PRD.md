## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Architecture Components**

**HomeViewModel**
```kotlin
// State Management
- uiState: StateFlow<HomeUiState>
- goals: StateFlow<List<Goal>>
- currentWeek: StateFlow<WeekOffset>
- userProfile: StateFlow<UserProfile?>

// Actions
- createGoal(text, image, position)
- updateGoalStatus(id, status)
- navigateToWeek(offset)
- reorderGoals(fromPosition, toPosition)
```

**HomeScreen Composable**
```kotlin
// Layout Management  
- ResponsiveLayout based on screen size
- LazyVerticalGrid for goal display
- PullRefresh for manual sync
- BottomSheetScaffold for goal creation
```

**Data Layer Integration**
```kotlin
// Repository Pattern
- GoalRepository: CRUD operations
- UserProfileRepository: Profile management  
- PreferencesRepository: App settings
- CacheManager: Local data caching
```

### **State Management**

**UI State Hierarchy**
```kotlin
sealed class HomeUiState {
    object Loading : HomeUiState()
    object Success : HomeUiState()  
    data class Error(val message: String) : HomeUiState()
}
```

**Goal State Tracking**
```kotlin
data class Goal(
    val id: String,
    val text: String,
    val status: GoalStatus,
    val imageUrl: String?,
    val position: Int,
    val weekOffset: Int
)
```

**Navigation State**
```kotlin
data class WeekNavigationState(
    val currentOffset: Int,
    val availableWeeks: List<Int>,
    val isLoading: Boolean
)
```
